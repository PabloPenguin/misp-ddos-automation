# GitHub Project Board Integration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines how to set up and use GitHub Projects for managing the MISP DDoS Automation project development workflow.

## Project Board Setup

### 1. Create New Project
1. Navigate to your GitHub profile/organization
2. Go to "Projects" tab
3. Click "New Project"
4. Choose "Team planning" template
5. Name: "MISP DDoS Automation"

### 2. Configure Project Views

#### Kanban Board View
- **Backlog**: New issues and feature requests
- **Sprint Planning**: Items being planned for next iteration
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Code Review**: Pull requests under review
- **Security Review**: Security-related items requiring special attention
- **Testing**: Items in testing phase
- **Done**: Completed items

#### Priority View
Filter by priority labels:
- `priority:critical` - Immediate attention required
- `priority:high` - Important, should be next
- `priority:medium` - Standard priority
- `priority:low` - Nice to have

#### Component View
Filter by component:
- `component:cli` - CLI tool development
- `component:webapp` - Web application
- `component:security` - Security features
- `component:docs` - Documentation
- `component:testing` - Test suite
- `component:infrastructure` - DevOps/deployment

### 3. Custom Fields
Add these custom fields to track additional metadata:

- **Story Points**: Number field (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
- **Epic**: Text field for grouping related issues
- **Security Impact**: Single select (None, Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Component**: Single select (CLI, WebApp, Security, Docs, Testing, Infrastructure)
- **Sprint**: Text field for sprint identification

## Automation Workflows

### Issue Automation
The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:

1. **New Issues**: Adds to project board in "Backlog" status
2. **Security Issues**: Moves to "Security Review" column
3. **Bug Reports**: Applies appropriate labels and priority
4. **Feature Requests**: Categorizes by component

### Pull Request Automation
- **New PRs**: Adds to project board in "Code Review" status
- **Security PRs**: Assigns security reviewers
- **Component PRs**: Assigns component-specific reviewers
- **Merged PRs**: Moves to "Done" status

### Label-based Automation
- **Priority Labels**: Auto-moves high priority items to top
- **Security Labels**: Triggers security review workflow
- **Bug Labels**: Moves to bug triage process

## Project Management Workflow

### Sprint Planning Process

1. **Backlog Grooming** (Weekly)
   ```
   - Review new issues in Backlog
   - Assign story points
   - Set priority labels
   - Move ready items to Sprint Planning
   ```

2. **Sprint Planning** (Bi-weekly)
   ```
   - Select items from Sprint Planning column
   - Assign to team members
   - Move to In Progress
   - Set sprint field
   ```

3. **Daily Standups**
   ```
   - Review In Progress items
   - Update status comments
   - Move blocked items appropriately
   ```

4. **Sprint Review**
   ```
   - Demo completed features
   - Move tested items to Done
   - Retrospective on process
   ```

### Issue Templates Integration

The project uses structured issue templates:

#### Feature Request Process
```mermaid

    A[Feature Request] --> B[Triage]
    B --> C[Backlog]
    C --> D[Sprint Planning]
    D --> E[In Progress]
    E --> F[Code Review]
    F --> G[Testing]
    G --> H[Done]
```

#### Bug Report Process
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Bug Report] --> B[Bug Triage]
    B --> C{Security?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Security Review]
    C -->|No| E[Backlog]
    D --> F[Priority Fix]
    E --> F
    F --> G[In Progress]
    G --> H[Testing]
    H --> I[Done]
```

#### Security Vulnerability Process
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Security Report] --> B[Private Triage]
    B --> C[Security Review]
    C --> D[Critical Fix]
    D --> E[Security Testing]
    E --> F[Coordinated Disclosure]
    F --> G[Done]
```

## Project Metrics and Reporting
